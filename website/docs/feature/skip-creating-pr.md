# Skip creating pull requests

[#202](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/tfaction/issues/202)

tfaction supports creating some types of pull requests.

* [Follow up Pull Request](follow-up-pr.md)
* [Scaffold working directory Pull Request](scaffold-working-dir.md)
* [Scaffold tfmigrate migration Pull Request](tfmigrate.md#scaffold-migration-pull-request)
* [Scaffold Terraform Module Pull Request](module.md)

They are really useful, but these pull requests are created by GitHub App so you can pass [1 approval Required](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging) by approving your changes by yourself.
To solve the problem, tfaction provides the setting `skip_create_pr` in `tfaction-root.yaml`.

```yaml
skip_create_pr: true # By default, this is false
```

If this is true, tfaction creates a feature branch and guides how to create a pull request but doesn't create a pull request.
Please see the tfaction's message and create a pull request by [gh pr create](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create) command.
