      {{template "link" .}}

      It failed to get a Terraform plan file from the pull request workflow run's artifacts.
      workflow run's headSha ({{.Vars.wf_sha}}) is different from the associated pull request's head sha ({{.Vars.pr_sha}}).

      plan_workflow_name: {{.Vars.plan_workflow_name}}
      branch: {{.Vars.branch}}

      Maybe the setting `plan_workflow_name` in `tfaction-root.yaml` is wrong.
      `plan_workflow_name` must be the workflow name where terraform plan is run in CI of pull requests.
